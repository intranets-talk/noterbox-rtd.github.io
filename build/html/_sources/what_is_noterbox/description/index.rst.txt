- By default NoterBox is designed as an "Inbox" style note-taking application and it tries to solve the problem of having information available when needed (even years later), for a person or an organization.
- Currently work in progress, NoterBox has an anti-social design (minimum sharing), and is made to be your personal search engine. Store any type of information in NoterBox and find it later through a powerful search engine.
- NoterBox is designed to be run as an "in-house" appliance.

.. note:: More details on the `NoterBox Features`_ page.

**What NoterBox is not?**

- NoterBox is not a synchronization service, and it does not synchronizes files across devices. It relies on one centralized storage, which can be accessed from other devices.
- Being built as a "single-user" centric application, Noterbox is not designed to be used as a "sharing" platform.

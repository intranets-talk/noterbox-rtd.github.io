Why & Philosophy
================

- Why another "note-taking" application?

	While NoterBox can be categorized a "note-taking" application, NoterBox is attempting to be more than that, respecively a data-capturing and storing facility.

	Not only because there is some much information that we need manage nowadays, but also because information can get lost. Additionally, people store information in several places: the email inbox, online services, computer desktop, Excel sheets, phone, etc.
	
	NoterBox is aiming to be the only "point of entry" for your data, all in one place, and easy to search. Just add "data".
